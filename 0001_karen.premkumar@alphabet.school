    <p><strong>Fifteen years ago</strong>, <em>aLphabet internationaL schooL</em> opened its doors with one big dream – to enable learners on how to think, not just what to think. Today, as we step boldly into our 16th year, that dream is stronger than ever – thanks to the International Baccalaureate (IB).</p>

    <p>To us, the IB is not just a label we showcase; rather, it’s the heartbeat of every lesson, question, and conversation inside our classrooms.</p>
    
    <p><strong>So what exactly is the IB?</strong> What makes it a credible choice for your learner’s education? And how does it help your child grow up ready for a world that’s changing faster than ever?</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em;color: #1f3a93;margin-top: 2em">So, What Is The IB?</h2>
    <p>The IB is not a rigid set of textbooks or rote exams; it is a way of learning that sparks curiosity, courage, and compassion.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Instead of just memorising facts, IB learners dive deep – they ask big questions, test ideas, and see how their learning connects to the real world. They don’t just study to pass a test but rather learn to understand, inquire, and make a difference.</p>
    <p>At its heart, the IB supports young minds to become independent thinkers, creative problem-solvers, and open-minded global citizens.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em;color: #1f3a93;margin-top: 2em">Why Do We Love the IB? Why Should You?</h2>
    <p>At <em>aLphabet</em>, we’ve always believed the best education is about holistic growth of the mind, heart, and sense of purpose. The IB matches this vision perfectly.</p>

    <ul style="padding-left: 20px;margin-bottom: 1.5em">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em"><strong>Students take the lead:</strong> They choose, question, experiment—and teachers guide them as mentors, not just lecturers.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em"><strong>It makes the world the classroom:</strong> From neighbourhood projects to global themes, students see the bigger picture and their place in it.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em"><strong>Skills for real life:</strong> Critical thinking, social skills, research, and communication are not taught as additional skills. They are built into every learning experience.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em"><strong>Character matters:</strong> Values like respect, empathy, honesty, and open-mindedness are built explicitly in the IB. It doesn’t just teach learners what to know but how to be.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em;color: #1f3a93;margin-top: 2em">What Does IB Learning Feel Like At aLphabet?</h2>
    <p>If you step into one of our classrooms, don’t be surprised if you don’t see rows of students memorising textbooks or teachers delivering lectures from a stage.</p>

    <ul style="padding-left: 20px;margin-bottom: 1.5em">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em">Groups huddled around giant mind maps, planning projects that combine Science, Social Studies, Languages, and the Arts.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em">Teachers create opportunities for inquiry instead of giving all the answers.</li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8em">Students capture what they’ve learned through journals, reflections, videos, and exhibitions as opposed to just ticking boxes on a test.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is learning that sticks. It is exciting and real—just like the world outside that awaits our learners!</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em;color: #1f3a93;margin-top: 2em">Why Does It Matter Right Now?</h2>
    <p>Let’s face it—our world is unpredictable. By the time today’s students graduate, they’ll need to solve problems we can’t even imagine yet. Along with all the skills and knowledge they acquire, they will need to rely heavily on curiosity, courage, creativity, and compassion to become successful global changemakers.</p>

    <p>The IB isn’t just about today’s test scores. It is about tomorrow’s thinkers, doers, and peacemakers. And at <em>aLphabet</em>, we’re proud to stand alongside our students as they grow into exactly that.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.75em;color: #1f3a93;margin-top: 2em">Let’s Keep Discovering Together!</h2>
    <p>As we celebrate another year of IB learning, we’re excited for what’s ahead: more questions, more big ideas, and more students discovering what they’re capable of.</p>
